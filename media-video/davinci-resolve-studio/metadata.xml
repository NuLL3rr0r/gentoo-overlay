        DaVinci Resolve is the world’s only solution that combines editing,
        color correction, visual effects, motion graphics and audio post
        production all in one software tool! Its elegant, modern interface
        is fast to learn and easy enough for new users, yet powerful for
        professionals. DaVinci Resolve lets you work faster and at a higher
        quality because you don’t have to learn multiple apps or switch
        software for different tasks. That means you can work with camera
        original quality images throughout the entire process. It’s like
        having your own post production studio in a single app! Best of all,
        by learning DaVinci Resolve, you’re learning how to use the exact same
        tools used by Hollywood professionals! Hardware support is limited.
        Nvidia cards should work fine. If you're running a hybrid setup, try
        with primusrun/optirun. This was originally written by Daniel Bermond
        in blackmagic-decklink-sdk pkgbuild.
